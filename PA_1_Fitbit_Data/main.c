     Description: Driver. Opens FILES, declare variables
                  needed for output. Needs access to a .csv file
                  containing fitbit data of 8 types of data per
                  line. It must be formatted per line in the following
                  method, excluding parantheses:
                    (Patient,minute,calories,distance,floors,heart,steps,sleep_level)
                  
     Alterations: If the user wishes to calculate the fitbit statistics from the
                  given .csv format within a lesser or larger amount of time
                  (total amount of minnutes), they can simply adjust the #define MINUTES_PER_DAY constant
                  within the header.h file for the amount of minutes in the provided file.
                  For example, if you want to only calculate statistics in half a day, place 1220
                  instead of 1440.
                  TRUE and FALSE definitions should remain untouched. If you have information that needs to be
                  included that equals a -1, adjust the BLANK definition in the header file to one not included
                  in the .csv file to read.
                  If the file to be read separates information other than ",", change the #define COMMA to equal
                  another character in which the information is separated.
                  If you wish to compare data from another fitbit, change the TARGET name to the correct fitbit
                  patient name.
